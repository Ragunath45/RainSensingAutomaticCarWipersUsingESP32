Automatic Car Wipers Using ESP32 and Google Firebase

Overview
This project aims to develop an innovative automatic car wipers system using the ESP32 microcontroller, rain sensor, and Google Firebase for remote monitoring and control. The system dynamically adjusts wiper speed based on real-time rain intensity, enhancing driver safety and convenience. Google Firebase integration allows users to remotely monitor and control the wiper system through a mobile app or web interface.

Features
Adaptive Wiping: Automatically adjusts wiper speed based on real-time rain intensity.
Firebase Integration: Enables remote monitoring and control via Google Firebase.
ESP32 Microcontroller: Serves as the central processing unit with intelligent algorithms.
Rain Sensor: Utilizes advanced sensing technologies for accurate rain detection.
Servo Motor Control: Precise control for smooth wiper movement.
Manual Override: Allows users to manually control wipers when needed.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive mobile app or web interface for easy monitoring and control.
Real-Time Updates: Provides instant updates on rain intensity and wiper status.

Installation
Install necessary libraries for ESP32 and Firebase.
Configure Firebase credentials in the ESP32 code.

Usage
